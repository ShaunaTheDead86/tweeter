# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Tweeter is meant to display my ability to use HTML Markup and CSS Stylesheets for web styling, and integrate Javascript and JQuery for web functionality.

[Tweeter has a fixed navigation bar and a simple "back to the top" button that appears after scrolling](back_to_top.gif)

[Tweeter has a drop down menu from the navigation bar that adds an area to write new tweets to the main page](new_tweet_preview.gif)

[Tweeter instantly displays your tweet at the top of the feed after posting](post_new_tweet.gif)

[Tweeter is also resizeable making it accessible from desktop, tablet, or mobile!](tweeter_resize.gif)
